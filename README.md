# SuspiciousApp
Kotlin app for Android phones to have a persistent app running even while the screen is locked and sending the device's location data, id and timestamp to your server.

I have no experience in App dev, so the code might be messy and illogical at times. Mostly reusing code scoured from the web and thanking the individuals accordingly in code comments.

Done for my thesis to demonstrate as a somewhat of an Android malware.

java/com.example.suspiciousapp/netSock contains netSock Kotlin object
java/com.example.suspiciousapp/snoopLocation contains snoopLocation.kt class and snoopLocationService.kt service
java/com.example.suspiciousapp contains in addition to above mentioned the FirstFragment.kt and MainActivity.kt

Rest of the files are in their default locations.
